# Beginners guide to GNU/Linux
## Chapter 1: What is GNU/Linux?
GNU/Linux is an operating system (in most cases) based on Unix
that people use to host Websites and File servers, it also runs on
everyday devices like your Phone, Car, TV and many other Devices,
Other than that, GNU/Linux is also a Normal Operating system for
your computer.
## Chapter 2: Why should I use GNU/Linux
GNU/Linux may not be that popular but in my opinion, it is better
than Windows. What is it like when you buy a car, but you cannot
see what is under the hood? That’s like a Windows PC. GNU/Linux
is completely an open-source project so you can have a look at the
source code of GNU/Linux, which is a plus. GNU/Linux is does not
need an antivirus because the developers of the distribution you
are using are always looking for weak points and fixing them so
that GNU/Linux stays secure, also no one would want to hack
GNU/Linux because it’s market share is under 2%. As the operating
systems evolve, so do their hardware requirements increase
exponentially. For instance, if you purchase a copy of Windows 10,
you will have to meet the minimum hardware requirements to run
it successfully, and you cannot run it on just about any low-end
system. One major advantage of using GNU/Linux instead of
Windows is customization. If you like tweaking your system’s
looks, GNU/Linux is simply perfect for you.ter 2: Why should I use GNU/Linux
## Chapter 3: Desktop Environments
You can customise nearly every inch of your GNU/Linux installation
to fit your liking, and it starts with choosing the right desktop
environment. If you want a Mac OS like Desktop Environment, you
might want to pick the GNOME Desktop Environment.

If you want a Windows like experience you might want to choose
one of these Desktop Environments.
